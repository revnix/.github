## Getting Involved

**1. Browse repos.** Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

**2. Open an issue before large changes.** Share the problem, your idea, and any questions.

**3. Fork → branch → PR.** Smaller, focused pull requests get reviewed faster.

**4. Use clear, simple English.** Many contributors are non‑native speakers—clarity helps everyone.

---

## Contribution Guidelines (Org‑Wide Defaults)

**Branches**  
`main` is protected. Use feature branches: `feature/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`, `docs/<short-name>`.

**Commit Style (recommended)**  
Conventional Commits (not forced, but helpful):
feat: add bulk importer to nextlycms api
fix: null check in supabase client
docs: update install steps
chore: bump deps

**Pull Requests**

- Link the related issue.
- Explain _what changed_ and _why_.
- Add screenshots / screen recordings for UI changes.
- Include setup + test steps so reviewers can reproduce.

**Coding Style**

- **TypeScript:** strict mode on in all TS/JS repos.
- **Lint / Format:** ESLint + Prettier (JS/TS); Ruff + Black (Python); PHPCS WordPress Standards (PHP/WP).
- `.editorconfig` at repo root when possible.

**Testing**

- Unit where it adds value.
- Light e2e smoke tests for deploy‑critical flows.
- Lint + type checks must pass CI.

---

## Org Conventions & Tooling

- **License:** MIT (default; see repo for overrides).
- **Default Branch:** `main`.
- **Node Version:** 20 LTS (update here if this changes).
- **Package Manager:** pnpm preferred (project may override if documented).
- **Environment Vars:** Ship a `.env.example`; never commit real secrets.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions (standard lint/test/build workflows per project).
